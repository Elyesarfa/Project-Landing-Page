        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The To-Do List App was built to address the common challenge of organizing and managing tasks effectively.
            Inspired by my personal struggles with task management, I wanted to create a solution that is intuitive, efficient, and accessible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my ability to build functional and user-friendly applications independently. 
            I focused on creating a clean design, implementing offline data storage, and ensuring a responsive user experience.
